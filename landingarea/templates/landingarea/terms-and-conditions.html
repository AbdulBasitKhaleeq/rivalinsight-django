    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
		<p><strong>Last updated 9 September 2018</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>The Services</strong></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The Services</strong>: This Agreement governs your use of our Services and any information provided to you resulting from your use of those Services.

				<li><strong>Warranties and exclusions</strong>: We warrant that during the Term we will: (a) provide the Services with reasonable skill and care; (b) maintain all licences and permissions necessary to perform our obligations under this Agreement; and (c) not make a material adverse change to the functionality of the Services.</li>
				<li><strong>Services</strong>: We will provide the Services in accordance with the Order Form and any supplemental scope of work. We exclude all liability for delays in performance that are due to your failure to provide what we need to complete the Professional Services.</li>
				<li><strong>Third Party Services</strong>: An Order Form may contain obligations on us to provide to you our Services and obligations on a third party to provide to you Third Party Services. The obligation to provide our Services creates a contract between us (as principal) and you (and that contract is this Agreement). The obligation to provide Third Party Services creates a contract between the third party (as principal) and you (to provide Third Party Services to you on the terms that are in place between you and the third party). We are only responsible to you for our Services and not any Third Party Services. We or a third party may send you an Order Form.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong>Your use of the services</strong></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Responsibility</strong>: You: (a) are responsible for your use of the Services and for your Users&rsquo; compliance with the online user guides, help and training materials, and your Users&rsquo; compliance with this Agreement (as if they were you); (b) will ensure that your use of Exported Data complies with Applicable Law; (c) will comply with the Twitter Terms of Service, usually at <a href="http://twitter.com/tos">http://twitter.com/tos</a>, and the facebook Terms of Service (d) will comply with the marketing materials we may provide to you related to your use and description of both our Services and our intellectual property rights.</li>
				<li><strong>User protection</strong>: You will not: (a) knowingly display, distribute, or otherwise make available <em>Rival Insights</em> Data to any person or entity that you reasonably believe will use Rival Insights Data in any manner that would have the potential to be inconsistent with that individual&rsquo;s reasonable expectations of privacy; (b) conduct any research or analysis that isolates a small group of individuals or any single individual for unlawful or discriminatory purposes; (c) use Rival Insights Data to target, segment, or profile any individual based on health, negative financial status or condition, political affiliation or beliefs, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, trade union membership, data relating to any alleged or actual commission of a crime, or any other sensitive categories of personal information prohibited by law.</li>
				<li><strong>Password protection</strong>: You are responsible for ensuring that any user IDs and passwords required for your Users to use Services are kept safe and confidential. You will promptly notify us upon discovery if the security of a user ID or password may be compromised.</li>
				<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: You will not: (a) sell, resell, license, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise make the Services (or the results of the Services) available to anybody other than your Users, unless stated otherwise on an Order Form; (b) subject to Applicable Law, attempt to reverse compile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise reduce to human-perceivable form any part of the Services; (c) use the Services or any Rival Insights Data to violate Applicable Law, including Applicable Law about data protection, privacy, or information security; (d) communicate any material which is obscene, defamatory, offensive, or abusive via the Services; or (e) purposefully interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of our Services, including spamming, hacking, purposefully violating or circumventing our API rate limits, or similar activities.</li>
				<li><strong>Removal of Rival Insights Data</strong>: A licensor or Applicable Law may require us to remove Rival Insights Data from our Services. In such cases, we will notify you of the impacted data and you will promptly remove the same Exported Data from your systems, whether during or after the Term.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong>Fees and payment for services</strong></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Fees</strong>: You will pay the fees for our Services set out in any Order Form. Except as otherwise specified, the fees are based on the Services set out in the Order Form and not on actual usage. The Services set out in the Order Form cannot be decreased during the relevant Term. If you sign an Order Form that a third party sends to you, you will pay the fees for our Services directly to the third party, who will collect the amounts due to us on our behalf. If you sign an Order Form that we send to you and that contains Third Party Services, you will pay us the fees for our Services and Third Party Services (although we collect the fees for Third Party Services as collecting agent only on behalf of the third party).</li>
				<li><strong>Taxes</strong>: The fees are exclusive of legally applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including goods and services, value-added, and sales taxes (collectively,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;</strong>). If we are legally required to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible, we (or a third party) will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide us (or a third party) with a valid tax exemption certificate by the appropriate taxing authority.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong>Confidential information</strong></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Confidential Information</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;means any information that is disclosed by a party (<strong>&ldquo;Disclosing Party&rdquo;</strong>) to the other party (<strong>&ldquo;Receiving Party&rdquo;</strong>) that is expressly marked as confidential or that a reasonable person under the circumstances would understand to be confidential. Our Confidential Information includes Rival Insights Data, trade secrets, non-public copyrighted materials, our product roadmap, and this Agreement. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) the Receiving Party knew prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) the Receiving Party independently developed.</li>

Nothing in this section 4 prevents the Receiving Party from disclosing the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to its corporate affiliates, legal advisers, accountants, or other professional advisers where required (collectively,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Permitted Recipients&rdquo;</strong>), provided that (i) the party so disclosing will remain responsible for its obligations and for the Permitted Recipients&rsquo; use (and any disclosure) of the Confidential Information.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></li>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Our intellectual property rights</strong>: We, or our licensors, own all intellectual property rights in the Services, including Rival Insights Data and Queries that we generate or write.

				<li><strong>Deliverables</strong>: Upon your payment of the fees for any deliverable from Professional Services (specified as such on an Order Form), you will retain all ownership rights to copyrightable works, work product, or other materials we created for you as part of those Professional Services; provided that if the deliverable contains Rival Insights Data, then the Rival Insights Data in the deliverable is granted to you under a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free licence to use the deliverable in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
				<li><strong>Exported Data Licence</strong>: We grant to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, licence to use the Exported Data in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
				<li><strong>Licence to use your feedback</strong>: You grant to us, and you undertake to procure that your Users grant to us, a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to use and incorporate into the Services any suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction, or other feedback provided by you or your Users arising out of your use of the Services.</li>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Term</strong>: The&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Initial Term&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;of this Agreement is the period designated as such on the Order Form, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement.
